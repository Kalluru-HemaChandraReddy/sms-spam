Detecting SMS spam is an essential task to keep our inboxes clean and free from unwanted messages. Several machine learning techniques can be employed for this purpose. Here are some notable approaches:
Naive Bayes Classifier:
The Naive Bayes model is commonly used for spam detection. It calculates the probability that a given SMS is spam or not based on the occurrence of specific words or features in the message.
By training the model on labeled data (spam and non-spam messages), it learns to distinguish between the two categories.
Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes:
This variant of the Naive Bayes classifier is particularly effective for text classification tasks.
It considers the frequency of word occurrences and is suitable for handling discrete features like word counts.
Logistic Regression:
